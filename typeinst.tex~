\section{Introduction}
 
The recognition, and simulation of human affects are becoming important fields of study, as many researchers have demonstrated that affective computers can provide better performance in assisting humans, and enhance a computers' abilities to make decisions \cite{affective-computing}. There are works describing different approaches for the recognition and simulation of affective states in human beings. For example, El Kaliouby, R., and Robinson, P. \cite{facial-expressions} proposed a system based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks that attained at recognizing affective states from a video stream of facial expressions and head gestures in real-time. As an example of the simulation of affective states, Becker-Asano, C., and Wachsmuth, I. \cite{affective-simulation} created MAX, a virtual human that simulates emotions in congruence to the mood of the person that interacts with it.

It didn't take long before these techniques were implemented as part of Intelligent Learning Environments (ILE). With the promise of an enhanced learning experience, researchers began studying the consequences of creating affect-sensitive ILEs. D'Mello, S., et al. \cite{autotutor} present the development of an affect-sensitive Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) called AutoTutor, which recognizes the emotions of a learner by monitoring conversational cues, gross body language, and facial features, and attempts to address the presence of negative emotional states with empathetic and motivational statements. Additionaly, Drummond, J., and Litman, D. \cite{zoning-out} explain a method based on machine learning classification models to asses if a student is zoning out during a spoken learning task.

But as more ILEs embrace these methodologies and techniques pertaining to the field of study known as Affective Computing \cite{affective-computing}, a problem arises. In order to perform a recognition of the users' affective states, a sensor must be used to gather data. Frequently, these sensors can be considered as intrusive or invasive \cite{intrusive1} \cite{intrusive2} \cite{intrusive3}, and can disrupt the learning experience of a student. In this work, a method is proposed for the recognition of affective states based on Keystroke and Mouse Dynamics. Keyboard and mouse input devices should address the problem of the intrusive nature of most sensors, as the vast majority of an ILE's users should be familiarized with the use of this hardware equipment nowadays, and should not regard them as an abnormal factor in the learning environment. Other advantages are their low cost, and high accessibility.

Research works related to Keystroke Dynamics (KD) are carried out either using fixed-texts, or free-texts \cite{free-text-fixed-text}. KD performed on fixed-texts involves the recognition of typing patterns when typing a preestablished fixed-length text, e.g., a password. In the other case, free-text KD achieves the recognition of typing patterns when typing an arbitrary-length text, e.g., a description of an item. However, as noted by Janakiraman, R., and Sim, T. \cite{fixed-is-better}, most of the research regarding KD is done on fixed-text input, the reason being that fixed-text KD usually yields better results than free-text KD. Yet, the authors of this work share the opinion with Janakiraman, R., and Sim, T., that it would be more useful if KD can handle free text as well as fixed text.

As a proof of the usefulness of free-text KD, the method for the recognition of affective states presented in this work is performed in an ITS focused on the teaching of software programming, where students need to input arbitrary-length source code. In this ITS, a student is required to solve a series of programming excercises, and, according to a feature vector extracted from the processed Keystroke and Mouse Dynamics data, a classification of two affective states (boredom and frustration) of the student is accomplished. This classification involves determining if a student was experiencing or not, or being indifferent to, each of the two affective states during the resolution of the programming excercises. With the proposed method, an ILE can predict a learner's affective states, and create better user models in order to provide adaptive, affect-sensitive content.

The structure of this work is organized as follows: Section \ref{related-work}

\section{Related Work}
\label{related-work}

Bosch, N., D'Mello, S., and Mills, C. \cite{emotions-novices-programming} analyzed the relationship between affective states and performance of novice programmers when they were learning the basics of computer programming in the Python language. The results of their study indicated that the major emotions students experienced were engaged, confusion, frustration, and boredom, with 23\%, 22\%, 14\%, and 12\% of the students experiencing these emotions, respectively. It was useful to consider these results, as it gives evidence of what affective states to be targeted in order to obtain less biased data. For example, if a rare emotion was chosen, a classifier could opt to classify any feature vector as not experiencing such emotion. Nevertheless, the classifier would obtain terrific results, although the classifier would be terrible at determining if a feature vector was actually experiencing the given affective state.

Similar to the previous work, Rodrigo, M.M.T., et al. \cite{emotions-novices-programming2} observed which affective states and behaviors relate to student's achievement within a Computer Science course. The authors found that confusion, boredom and egagement in IDE-related on-task conversation are associated with lower achievement.

Although the use of Keystroke Dynamics (KD) can be found in several research works as a biometric measure, its use as a mechanism for identifying affective states is rare in comparison. Epp, C., Lippold, M., and Mandryk, R.L. \cite{keystroke-dynamics1} effectively used KD in conjunction with decision-tree classifiers for the identification of 15 affective states. Although their work was based on fixed-text KD, their decisions on how to extract a feature set from the data generated by the KD process was a great inspiration for the proposed method in this work. As for free-text KD, Bixler, R., and D'Mello, S. \cite{keystroke-dynamics2} present a method for the identification of boredom and engagement based on several classification models.

Regarding Mouse Dynamics (MD), some research has been conducted for the identification of affective states, although, as with the case of KD, MD is mainly used as a biometric measure for authentication processes. Salmeron-Majadas, S., Santos, O.C., and Boticario, J.G. \cite{mouse-dynamics1} use both MD and KD to predict four affective states using five different classification algorithms. Bakhtiyari, K., and Husain, H. \cite{mouse-dynamics2} discuss a method based on fuzzy models for the recognition of emotions through KD, MD and touch-screen interactions. For a broad review of emotion recognition methods based on KD and MD, the work by Kolakowska, A. \cite{keystroke-mouse-review} is recommended.

It has to be mentioned that a numerous list of works pertaining to affect-aware ILEs exists, but the following remarkable works are presented: Woolf, B., et al. \cite{affect-aware-general1} describe an approach to redress the cognitive versus affective imbalance in teaching systems; San Pedro, M.O.Z., et al. \cite{affect-aware-general2} present a method based on classifiers that predicts student affect and knowledge; and lastly, Wang, C.Y., et al. \cite{affect-aware-general3} propose an approach to develop an emotionally interactive learning system, where learners can express their emotions by mouse-clicking.

\section{Proposed Method}
\label{proposed-method}

An Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) was built to obtain the necessary data (it can be found online at http://app.protoboard.org/). The ITS's course begins with three introductory videos that explain the fundamentals of programming in Python, and how to solve the programming exercises in the course. What follows after these videos are ten programming exercises, that the students need to solve in a consecutive manner.

In Figure \ref{protoboard}, the interface of this ITS is presented. On the left, a navigation tree is shown, where students can click on the different learning objects that the course contains. On the right, a text processor is embedded, where students can try to solve the programming exercise described below.

\subsubsection{Capturing the Keystroke and Mouse Data}

While a student is trying to solve an exercise, a script coded in JavaScript is running in the background, which captures every keystroke, mouse movement and mouse button press. Each capture of these events records a date in milliseconds (using the method getTime() of JavaScript's built-in object Date) that describes when the event occurred. If the event is a keystroke, the script captures what key was specifically pressed (a JavaScript key code), and what type of event occurred (it can be either a key-down or a key-up event). If it is an event related to a mouse button press, the key code of that button is recorded, as well as the type of event occurred (key-down or key-up). Finally, if the event was a mouse movement, the mouse coordinates inside of the web browser is recorded. The script monitors the mouse position every 100 milliseconds, and if the position has changed, it records the new position.

\subsubsection{Capturing the Affective States}

In order to determine what affective states a student was experiencing, an Experience Sampling Method (ESM) was used \cite{esm}. After the students successfully solve a programming exercise, they are presented with an ESM survey that asks what they were feeling during their solving of the exercise. A very brief description is given about what to do in this survey, followed by two statements the students need to answer according to how they were feeling. As an example, the statement ''I was feeling frustrated'' is presented, and a student needs to answer either ''Strongly agree,'' ''Agree,'' ''Neutral,'' ''Disagree,'' and ''Strongly Disagree.'' The full ESM survey is presented in Figure \ref{esm-survey}.

\subsubsection{Preprocessing of the Keystroke and Mouse Data}

The raw data obtained from the JavaScript script needs to be preprocessed in a way that results in a feature vector. Basically, this preprocessing consists in measuring the delays between key-down or key-up events of the keystrokes and mouse button presses a student performed during an exercise. The averages and standard deviations are calculated for each of these delays. To calculate these delays, the keystrokes are grouped in digraphs and trigraphs, as it is a common practice when dealing with Keystroke Dynamics \cite{digraph-trigraph}.

As most of the mouse button presses performed by a web site user are left button clicks, only these button presses are considered. To calculate the average and standard deviations of these presses, the delays between key-down and a key-up events of the left button clicks are used.

In addition to these averages and standard deviations of the delays between keystrokes and mouse button presses, the average and standard deviations of the number of total events contained in a digraph and a trigraph are calculated. These features are proposed and explained by Epp, C., Lippold, M., and Mandryk, R.L. in \cite{keystroke-dynamics1}. Most of the times, a digraph should contain four events, while a trigraph should contain six events. However, some times an individual can start a digraph or a trigraph before ending the previous one. This additional features represent these particular cases, and could be meaningful for the estimation of an individual's affective states.

Regarding the mouse movements, the average and standard deviation of the duration of each mouse movement are calculated, and the averages and standard deviations of the movements in the X and Y axes
